These are companion Jupyter notebooks
([info](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html))
of a scientific article, which explain part of the methodology used therein.

Simply opening the notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) on GitHub will run the embedded code on the GitHub server and populate
the page with results.
It's also possible to download a copy of the notebook and the required data files (Numpy and CSV formats) and
execute it on your own machine, not on the server. In order to do this, you will need Jupyter and Python
installations, together with all the Python libraries used in the notebooks. It'll be easiest to install the newest
[Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution, which will install everything in one go. Then, just
start a Jupter server on your machine and open the notebook. you will be able to execute and modify the code
embedded in the notebooks.
